Sri Vimalananda Bharathi Swamy, originally named Trivikramarama Rao, was born on August 20, 1878, in Chemuudupadu village, Krishna District. He was the son of Surya Narayana and Adilakshmi.\n\nHe pursued his education in Bandaru town (Vijayawada) and later served as a teacher at the Noble High School. During his tenure as a teacher, he mentored several distinguished personalities, including Viswanadha Satyanarayana and Pingali Lakshmikantam, who went on to become renowned figures in Telugu literature.\n\nAfter his teaching career, Sri Trivikramarama Rao moved to Tiruvananthapuram to pursue a Law degree. His quest for knowledge extended beyond academics into the realm of spiritual research. He dedicated himself to the study of 'Sutrabhashyam', guided by the divine presence of Sringeri Acharya Sri Nrusimha Bharathi Swamy and the esteemed scholar Vadapalli Pattabhiramayya.\n\nThe speeches of Sri Vimalananda Bharathi Swamy on the Upanishads, Brahmasutras, and Bhagavad Gita are considered as timeless and must listen.\n\nIn his middle age, Sri Trivikramarama Rao was profoundly influenced by Donthulamma (Donthurulamma). He came to believe that true Atmadarshana (self-realization) could not be attained while bound by the ties of worldly life (samsara bandha). Determined to put the principles of Tattvika Bodha into practice, he resolved to embrace the path of renunciation.\n\nHe was initiated into Sanyasadeeksha by the then Pontiff of Sringeri Virupaksha Peetam Sri Kalyanananda Bharathi Swamy, who bestowed upon him the name Vimalananda Bharathi Swamy. From then on, he lived as a shining example of Brahmagnana (knowledge of Brahman) and Brahmanistha (steadfastness in Brahman), continuing to spread the light of Tattvaprabodham.\n\nSri Vimalananda Bharathi Swamy nurtured a deep interest in poetry in his childhood days and composed numerous devotional verses dedicated to the Almighty. However, as his vairagya (detachment) intensified, he gradually relinquished all desire for worldly comforts, power, wealth, and even poetry itself, immersing fully in spiritual pursuit.\n\nFollowing the Mahasamadhi of Mounaswamy, Sri Vimalananda Bharathi Swamy assumed the responsibilities of spiritual leadership and became the first Pontiff of Sri Siddheswari Peetam. He continued his teachings on Brahmagnana with unwavering dedication until he attained siddhi on January 25, 1950.
