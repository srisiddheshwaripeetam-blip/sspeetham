He went on to complete his F.A. and B.A. degrees at Noble College, Bandaru, and later obtained his Law degree from Hindu University, Kashi.\n\nWhile flourishing in his career as a lawyer, his revered guru Sri Trivikrama Rao embraced Sanyasadeeksha and assumed the responsibilities as the first Pontiff of Sri Siddheswari Peetam.

Following the siddhi of Sri Vimalananda Bharathi Swamy, he became the second Pontiff of Sri Siddheswari Peetam.\n\nBlessed with a melodious voice, Sri Trivikramaramananda Bharathi Swamy's recitations of slokas and the Lalitha Sahasranama Stotram resonated deeply within the community, drawing devotees to his presence. His archana to Siddheswari Ammavaru, performed with the chanting of Lalitha Sahasranama, was revered as if sages like Hayagriva or Agastya themselves had come to perform the sacred rituals.\n\nDuring his tenure, he traveled extensively across India (Bharat), spreading the message of Veda Dharma and delivering numerous discourses. His spiritual leadership brought widespread acclaim to the Sri Siddheswari Peetam, strengthening its role as a beacon of devotion and knowledge.\n\nOn January 12, 1991, Sri Trivikramaramananda Bharathi Swamy announced Sri Bandhakavi Seetarama Anjaneyulu, a renowned lawyer from Tanuku, as his successor-designate.
